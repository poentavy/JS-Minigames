 2 small game projects : "Pig-Game" and "Guess the number"
# Pig Game
Pig Game is a fun and interactive dice game where players take turns rolling a six-sided die. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach a total score of 100 or more. However, beware of rolling a 1, as it will cause you to lose all the points you've accumulated in that turn . The game offers a challenging and strategic gameplay experience, as players must decide when to stop rolling and bank their points to avoid losing them. 

# Guess the Number
Guess the Number is a classic guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides clues to help the player narrow down their guesses. With each incorrect guess, the game informs the player if the actual number is higher or lower, allowing them to adjust their subsequent guesses accordingly.
